These are the instructions for recreating JAXB classes whenever the MMD RelaxNG definition is modified. Its a semi-automated process, there is no coding required
but there are a couple of manual steps.

1. Ensure Trang installed  (linux ubuntu apt-get install trang, or available from http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html)

2. Convert rng to xsd
3. Amend the XSD schema
4. Generate java classes from xsd
5. Amend the Java classes
   Ignore files with timestamp change only
   ../utils/regenerate-jaxb-files

6. Build package and then install locally so visible to search server project
   mvn install
