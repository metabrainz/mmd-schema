These are the instructions for recreating JAXB classes whenever the MMD RelaxNG definition is modified. Its a semi-automated process, there is no coding required
but there are a couple of manual steps.

1. Ensure Trang installed  (linux ubuntu apt-get install trang, or available from http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html)

2. Convert rng to xsd
(Ubuntu)trang ../schema/musicbrainz_mmd-2.0.rng src/main/resources/musicbrainz_mmd-2.0.xsd
(Other) java -jar trang.jar ../schema/musicbrainz_mmd-2.0.rng src/main/resources/musicbrainz_mmd-2.0.xsd

3. Amend the XSD schema
   ../utils/patch-xsd-schema

4. Generate java classes from xsd
   mvn org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2:maven-jaxb2-plugin:generate

5. Edit DiscList.java and MediumList.java, adding "count", "offset" to the prop order for those classes. Do the same for the TrackList class in Medium.java.

6. Build package and then install locally so visible to search server project
   mvn install
