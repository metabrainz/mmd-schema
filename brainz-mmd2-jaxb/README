The MusicBrainz XML Metadata Schema Java Binding
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the official Java binding (JAXB)
for the MusicBrainz XML Metadata (MMD) schema version 2.

Most of the files are generated by a script.

The files can be bundled as a Maven package.

== Regenerate files ==

Whenever the MMD RELAX NG definition is modified,
regenerate the XSD schema and the Java classes with:

```sh
docker-compose --project-directory=docker/brainz-mmd2-jaxb run --rm builder
```

== Maven artifact ==

See instructions for the repository [`mb-solr`](https://github.com/metabrainz/mb-solr/)
from which this binding is made accessible through Maven locally for building MB Solr.
