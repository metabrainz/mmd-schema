MusicBrainz Web Service XML Examples
====================================

This directory contains example XML code for testing an implementation.

Implementations MUST be able to parse the XML in the `valid` directory.
It is perfect, schema-compliant XML.

The `invalid` directory contains all kinds of invalid XML. Implementations
are not expected to parse those files. They MAY, however.
